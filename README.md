# compile-start
a simple program to compile single or multiple files and run them

to run compile and run , put the script in a folder where your scripts are located , then go in the terminal and enter ./start 'namefile1' 'namefile2' etc 



note : im only starting to learn the c language so this is probably far from an optimized code
