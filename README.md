# compile-start
a simple program to compile single or multiple C files and run them

to run compile and run , put the script in a folder where your scripts are located , then go in the terminal and enter ./start 'namefile1' 'namefile2' etc 

if you are using linux , take the 'script' file . if you are using windows take the start.exe file

if you want to modify my code , i put all the source code in start.c


note : im only starting to learn the c language so this is probably far from an optimized code
